# Deli_Order_GUI
A Python GUI for ordering from a Deli.
TO DO:
Currently: I have all labels and entry fields. The Submit button is present. The programs title is displayed. I have the drop-down menu set up.

Problems: The total price is not calculated yet. There are no input validations. Buttons are not disabled. The price has an editable entry field. 

Next Step: Add a formula for calculating price. Add input validations. Disable buttons and fields on end. Get rid of the editable entry field on price.

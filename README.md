# Deli_Order_GUI
A Python GUI for ordering from a Deli.

Currently: I have all labels and entry fields. The Submit button is working. The programs title is displayed. The total price label is added on submit.

Problems: The total price is not calculated yet. The Meat and cheese need a drop down. There are no input validations. Buttons are not disabled. The price has an entry field.

Next Step: Add a formula for calculating price. Add drop down menus to the meat and cheese field. Add input validations. Disable buttons and fields on end. Get rid of the editable entry field on price.
